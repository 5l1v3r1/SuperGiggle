When working with a **legacy code** or an already existing huge code, validating the existing code may become a big nightmare and you nust can't improve the legacy code overnight.

But at the same time you still WANT to implement **good practices** and **standardize**, at least, your new code. **SuperGiggle** is about checking just the new changes you have made in your repository, ignoring the already existing code. You can even use **super-giggle** in your CI tools as well.
